# pedlab
A custom pedestrian simulator.

The node provides a simulation of a robot and a set of people using a Social Force Model.

## Robot simulation
* The robot offers an interface to be controlled
* 360ยบ 2D laser scans are simulated for the robot
* Detections of the persons presented are also simulated

## Person simulation

The persons are affected by the robot and other persons using the social force model
