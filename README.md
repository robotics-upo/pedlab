# pedlab
A custom pedestrian simulator.

The node provides a simulation of a robot and a set of people using a Social Force Model.

**[DOCUMENTATION UNDER CONSTRUCTION]**

## Robot simulation
* The robot offers an interface to be controlled
* 360ยบ 2D laser scans are simulated for the robot
* Detections of the persons presented are also simulated

## Person simulation

The persons are affected by the robot and other persons using the social force model

# Simulation configuration files



# ROS API

## Subscribed topics

The node subscribes to the following topics. The names can be configured (see ROS params section)

* */cmd\_vel*: <geometry_msgs::Twist>. Control command of the robot.
* */target/cmd_vel*: <geometry_msgs::Twist>. It is used to command another agent (pedestrian) which is not the the robot. To be used, the parameter "*teleoperated\_target*" must be True.

## Published topics

The following topics are published. The names can be configured (see below)

* */scan360*: <sensor_msgs::LaserScan> simulated 360ยบ robot laser.
* */odom*: <nav_msgs::Oodometry> Robot odometry.
* */people\_detections*: <people_msgs::People> publication of the people detected.
* */plab/markers/detected_people*: <visualization_msgs::MarkerArray> RViz marker of the people detected by the agent.
* */plab/markers/people*: <animated_marker_msgs::AnimatedMarkerArray> RViz animated marker of the people in the scene.


## ROS params

### Scenario configuration
* *config_file*: route and name of the scenario configuration file (see section [Simulation configuration files](# Simulation configuration files)).
* *freq*: Execution frequency of the simulation and the publication of topics (Default: 15 Hz).

### Laser scan configuration
* *scan360\_id*: topic name for simulated laser (default: "/scan360").
* *scan360_readings*: number of beams of the simulated laser scan (default: 1440).
* *scan\_range\_max*: maximum range distance of the scan (default: 10 m).

### Robot configuration
* *cmd\_vel_id*: topic name to control the robot (default:"/cmd_vel").
* *robot\_radius*: radius of the circumference that circumscribes the robot footprint (default: 0.3 m).
* *robot\_max\_velocity*: robot maximum velocity allowed (default: 0.6 m/s).
* *pose\_initial\_x*: initial robot position in the X-axis of the map (m).
* *pose\_initial\_y*: initial robot position in the Y-axis of the map(m).
* *pose\_initial\_yaw*: initial robot heading in the map (rad).
* *odom_id*: topic name of the robot odometry published by the simulator (default: "/odom").

### Simulated people configuration
* *teleoperated\_target*: boolean to give the option of teleoperating one of the human agents (default: false).
* *cmd\_vel\_target\_id*: topic name to control the human agent (default: "/target/cmd_vel").
* *person\_radius*: radius of the circumference that circumscribes the human footprint (default: 0.35 m).
* *people\_average\_vel*: average velocity of the simulated pedestrians (default: 0.9 m/s).
* *people\_sd\_vel*: standard deviation of the normal distribution that represents the pedestrian velocities (default: 0.001 m/s).
* *target\_cyclic\_goals*: it indicates whether the pedestrian used as target (for instance to be accompanied by the robot) performs a cyclic movements among its destination goals (default: false).
* *target\_force\_factor\_desired*: factor of the desired force to reach the goal for the simulated pedestrian marked as target (see the [Social Force Model](https://github.com/robotics-upo/lightsfm/tree/refactored)) (default: 4.0).


### Uncertainty configuration
* *people\_detection\_range*:
* *noisy\_detections*:
* *sd\_noise*:
* *sd\_noise\_theta*:
* *false\_negative\_prob*:
* *perfect\_tracking*:
