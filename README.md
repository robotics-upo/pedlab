# pedlab
A custom pedestrian simulator.

The node provides a simulation of a robot and a set of people using a Social Force Model.

**[DOCUMENTATION UNDER CONSTRUCTION]**

## Robot simulation
* The robot offers an interface to be controlled
* 360ยบ 2D laser scans are simulated for the robot
* Detections of the persons presented are also simulated

## Person simulation

The persons are affected by the robot and other persons using the social force model

# Simulation configuration files



# ROS API

## Subscribed topics

The node subscribes to the following topics. The names can be configured (see ROS params section)

* */cmd\_vel*: <geometry_msgs::Twist>. Control command of the robot.
* */target/cmd_vel*: <geometry_msgs::Twist>. It is used to command another agent (pedestrian) which is not the the robot. To be used, the parameter "*teleoperated\_target*" must be True.

## Published topics

The following topics are published. The names can be configured (see below)

* */scan360*: <sensor_msgs::LaserScan> simulated 360ยบ robot laser.
* */odom*: <nav_msgs::Oodometry> Robot odometry.
* */people\_detections*: <people_msgs::People> publication of the people detected.
* */plab/markers/detected_people*: <visualization_msgs::MarkerArray> RViz marker of the people detected by the agent.
* */plab/markers/people*: <animated_marker_msgs::AnimatedMarkerArray> RViz animated marker of the people in the scene.
