# pedlab
A custom pedestrian simulator.

The node provides a simulation of a robot and a set of people using a Social Force Model.

It is based on ROS and uses RViz for visualization.

**[DOCUMENTATION UNDER CONSTRUCTION]**

## Robot simulation
* The robot offers an interface to be controlled
* 360ยบ 2D laser scans are simulated for the robot
* Detections of the persons presented are also simulated

## Person simulation

The persons are affected by the robot and other persons using the [Social Force Model](https://github.com/robotics-upo/lightsfm/tree/refactored)

# Simulation configuration files

The definition of the number of simulated pedestrians in the scenario and the goal positions that they must reach are provided through a simple XML file.

An example file is shown next:

```html
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<scenario>

  <!-- definition of goals and itermediate points-->
  <goal id ="A" x="7"  y="32" r="1"/> 	 
  <goal id ="B" x="27" y="7"  r="1"/>
  <waypoint id="D" x="27" y ="32" r="1"/>

  <!-- paths between goals -->
  <edge from="A" to="D"/>
  <edge from="D" to="B"/>

  <!-- pedestrian with initial position and goals to reach -->
  <agent x="6" y="31" n="2" dx="0" dy="0" type="1">
    <addwaypoint id="A"/>
    <addwaypoint id="B"/>
  </agent>

</scenario>
```

The configuration must be enclosed between the tags ```<scenario></scenario>```.

First, the different goals that the pedestrians must be reach can be indicated through the tag ```<goal/>``` with the arguments:
* *id*, identifier of the goal.
* position in the map, *x* coordinate (m) and *y* coordinate (m).
* Admisible distance from the goal point to consider that the goal has been reached *r* (m).

With the tag ```<waypoint/>``` is possible to add intermediate goals that can be used as points that the agents must visit to in the way to reach their goals.

Secondly, the tag ```<edge/>``` is used to connect the different goals and waypoints similarly to a graph. This way, the agents must follow the defined edges to reach the different goals.

Finally, each agent in the scenario is indicated by the tag ```<agent></agent>```, with the following arguments:
* Initial position in the map indicated by the arguments *x* and *y*.
* Arguments *dx* and *dy* employed to feed an uniform distribution to randomly vary the position of the agent.
* Type of agent, that can be *1*: regular pedestrian, or *2*: target pedestrian (a pedestrian that forms a walking group with the robot).
Moreover, the goals that the agent must try to reach are indicated by the *id* argument in the tag ```<addwaypoint/>```


# ROS API

# ROS Dependencies
 
* Animated Markers for the markers for persons in RViz: https://github.com/srl-freiburg/animated_markers

# Example launch file

```sh
roslaunch pedlab corridors.launch
```
This will launch a corridor scenario where a group of two pedestrians and a target pedestrian (accompanying the robot) are launched.
The robot is represented by the TF "base_link", and it is a regular differential robot that can be controlled through the topic "/cmd_vel".


# Edition node

A secondary ROS node has been also implemented as a simple tool for creating scenario configuration files.
It makes use of [RViz](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz) and [map\_server](http://wiki.ros.org/map_server).
With the map\_server an existing map can be loaded and published in ROS. Or even a blank map with the desired dimensions can be employed.
Then, the map can be visualized in RViz. The map is used as a reference to build a new simulation scenario.
To do it, the "publish point" tool of RViz is employed. By clicking on the desired map location in RViz, a new node (pedestrian goal) will be created. Nodes that are closer than an indicated distance threshold will be automatically linked and an edge between them will be created. 

Once the edition node is finished (CTRL+c shortkey), the configuration file is saved. 
Finally, the desired agents must be added manually to the configuration file created. 


## ROS API

### Subscribed topics

* */clicked\_point*: <geometry_msgs::PointStamped>. Point coordinates published by RViz "publish_point" tool.

### Published topics

* */plab/markers/edited\_nodes*: <visualization_msgs::MarkerArray> spheres representing the pedestrian goals in the scenario.
* */plab/markers/edited\_edges*: <visualization_msgs::Marker> list of lines (edges) that join the goal nodes and represent the paths to reach the goals.

### ROS params

* *file*: route and name of the configuration file that is going to be created (default: graph.xml)
* *freq*: frequency of topic publication (default: 15 Hz)
* *distance*: maximum distance between nodes to be connected by an edge (default: 3.0 m)

### Example launch file

```sh
roslaunch pedlab editor_example.launch
